# Full Stack Django Frameworks Milestone Project
This is a Phototgallery that allows photographers to post their pictures online to download for free by users across the world. 

# UX
The design of the website is simple and it is straight forward how to use it. It is responsive and it has been developed with the end user in mind. The navigation has bg image and the text is white.
The page uses a flexbox grid to align the pictures on the screen, allowing for a clean interface. There is a detail page where a user can donwload the picture and donate a sum to the non profit company if he chooses do to so. On the left upper corner on the detail page, there 
is a little bit of info about the photgrapher. When clicked on it, you get redirected to the profile of that photographer where you can view an intro and his picture. There is a search bar to make navigation easier by searching a certain category of pictures. There is a leader board page where 
visitors can view the most popular photgrpahers ranked in a top thirty listing.
